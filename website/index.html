          <h3>The Coffee Stop</h3>
            <p>
              After seeing this awesome scroll animation from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXIO7mGTwk0'>codegrid</a>, i had to try to recreate this frontend theme.
              So after cropping the cup, stacking it on top of the original image and updating the original images transform property with the scale method being updated by a little bit of
              vanilla JS, and voila!

            Hello and welcome to my site, My name is Shaun and I am a fullstack developer from los angeles california. When im not developing you can usually find me at local
            Javascript meetups or online playing any games from bethesda or from software. Recently i have been dabbling in design with photoshop and illustrator
            and when time permits gameplay physics with canvas.
