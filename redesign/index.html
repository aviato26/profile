          <h3>The Coffee Stop</h3>
            <p>
              After seeing this awesome scroll animation from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXIO7mGTwk0'>codegrid</a>, i had to try to recreate this frontend theme.
              So after cropping the cup, stacking it on top of the original image and updating the original images transform property with the scale method being updated by a little bit of
              vanilla JS, and voila!
            </p>
